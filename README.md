# Ducks

## Description

The Ducks Project is a Java-based implementation that simulates various duck types and their behaviors using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and Design Patterns. This project demonstrates how polymorphism, interfaces, and dynamic behavior assignments can create flexible and reusable code structures. The application follows the Strategy Design Pattern, where behaviors like flying, quacking, and swimming are encapsulated into separate classes and assigned at runtime.

## Features

Strategy Design Pattern Implementation

Multiple Duck Types

Code Reusability and Modularity

## Class Overview

Duck (Abstract Class): Base class containing behavior references and common methods.

MallardDuck: Represents a mallard duck with default behaviors.

RedHeadDuck: Represents a redhead duck.

RubberDuck: Represents a rubber duck with unique quacking behavior.

DecoyDuck: Represents a decoy duck that cannot quack or fly.

## Behaviors

### Flying Behaviors

CanFly: Ducks that can fly.

CannotFly: Ducks that cannot fly.

### Quacking Behaviors

Quack: Ducks that quack normally.

MuteQuack: Ducks that do not quack.
